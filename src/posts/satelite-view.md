### Domain Real Estate

The idea behind domain name realestate is to invest in a good quality domain name at a low price, develop the property and sell it for a reasonable profit

Story:

Ideasmen - How can I‌ make a micro business out of keyboard shorts?

I just bought kbshortcut.com

I'm thinking about spinning up a micro-business around this domain name the idea is simple.

\*‌ Gather a list of keyboard shortcuts for various applications.

\*‌ Include the O/S specific keyboard shortcuts for each major operating system.

\*‌ Use crowdsourcing to find more keyboard lists and shortcuts for various applications

\*‌ Convert this lists into beautiful keyboard shortcut cheatsheets

\*‌ Ensure accuracy using ratings - likes/dislikes

\*‌ Learn your keyboard shortcuts through Gamification.

Keyboard cheatsheets are a useful way of remembering shortcuts, but I believe a better way to learn keyboard shortcuts would be to use gamification.

The idea is simply to create a little game where a character moves based on successful memorization and recall for various keyboard shortcuts

I know that I can find heaps of content because there are keyboard shortcut lists for almost every application or operating system you can think of.

I also think I could Gamify the learning of Keyboard Shortcuts by building a simple game, like a maze and to get through the maze, you would need to press the right key combination to move forward.

Before starting the game, you would pick the application that you want to learn keyboard short cuts for and then it would ask you a question such as, how do you copy selected text and you would press the correct key combination, Ctrl+C and then you would progress forward.

### Micro Apps

#### App: Outdoor Gym Locator

Tags: IdeasMen, AppyDave
Todo: Tag Line

As a person who wants to get fit, I want to locate an outdoor Gym that is nearby, so that I can have a quick workout

##### How does the outdoor gym locator work?

Via app or website, anyone can upload photo's of an outdoor GYM
Anyone can write a description for the Gym Location
Gym descriptions can be up voted
Gym descriptions can be down voted
Gym descriptions can be reported
Gym images can be up voted
Gym images can be down voted
Gym images can be reported
Gym location can be up voted
Gym location can be down voted
Gym location can be reported
Gm availability can be up voted
Gym availability can be down voted
Gym availability can be reported
Gym location QR code can be printed so that it can be displayed at the location

The EXIF location coordinates can be read from the data tagged on the photo and this information can be used along with Google Maps to tag outdoor gyms

##### Ideas for gym locator

- Monetization: Flip the domain with working application and prefilled content
- Marketing: How to find users: Ask questions in FB Groups, Quora, elsewhere.

#### App: Alias Builder

Tags: IdeasMen, AppyDave
Todo: Tag Line

As someone who uses complex command line statements, I would like to use easy to remember alias', so that I save time and don't make mistakes.

##### Alias Builder: How does it work

### Command Line

### DSL

A domain specific language is a set of human readable language extensions that when encountered run a particular workflow.

#### Markdown DSL's

This DSL is really just some custom extensions that can annotate an ordinary markdown file.
The way it works is that when running, it just watches a list of folder structures (and children)
It can find some configuration to work with when needed
When it encounters an changed markdown file, it looks for an anotation and runs it appropriately

Tags: IdeasMen (just do a little video and call it an idea)

##### What type of technology should I use, hmmmm

- Markdown watcher DSL
  - what it does is watch for tokens in a Marken file and automatically generate new markdown files.
  - I can use a Klueless style DSL
  - I can use an external watcher like watchman and then just fire some parsing code
    - Could use Elixr, Go, Ruby or Node JS to pass the file
- Visual Studio Extension
  - Write an extensions

##### Use case

You have just written a section in the Markdown file and you realize that it would be good to create a new markdown file and extract that section out to a child or parent markdown.

You also realize that you would like to create a specific type of markdown file, aka templated file.

You just select you text, type in a DSL token and PewPew!!!!

##### Sample Workflow

This sample workflow lists the steps that you might do if this was a working DSL

- You write a large section of text
- You select the text and cut or copy it
- You type in a !md new f:sub-folder/title-of-new-document t:[optional template name here] o:true
- A new file is created in `sub-folder/title-of-new-document.md`
- It uses a default template or whatever is supplied to create the new markdown file
- o:t is `overwrite = true`
